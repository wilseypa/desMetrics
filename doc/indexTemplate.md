<!-- 
  this next paragraph assumes that the tools generate a file "model_summary.html" that
  contains information on the tool, simulation model, command line arguments, and
  configuration information.  in each section below, the image name in the markdown link
  should be the name of the file generated by the analysis tool corresponding to the
  description in that section.

This page summarizes results from analyzing the characteristics of the event profile of a
discrete event simulation model.  The the model name, the tool its profile characteristics
were generated from, the date of the capture, and the relevant command line arguments and
configuration parameters are available [here](./graphs/model_summary.html).

The following analysis activities are parallel simulation centric.  Thus, we assume, for
example, that the discrete event simulation is composed of events processed by simulation
objects. 

## Event Execution Summaries

### Total Number of Events Executed by the Simulation Objects

This is an x-y chart that summarizes the total events processed in the simulation.

* x-axis: labeled "Simulation Objects", enumerates the names of the simulation objects
  in the model.  

* y-axis: labeled "Total Number of Events", show the total number of events that are
  to be executed by the corresponding simulation object.

* Computed as: for each simulation object, simply sum the number of events that are
  with a "destination_object" field corresponding to that simulation object.

### Number of Simulation Objects Executing X Events

This an x-y chart that shows the number of simulation objects that process X events.  

* x-axis: labeled "Number of Events Executed" contains the integer range of events (from
  minimum to maximum) executed by any simulation object in the model.  For example, assume
  that N is the minimum number of events executed by a simulation object and M is the
  maximum number of events excuted by a simulation object, then the x-axis will be the
  range N:M.

* y-axis: labeled "Number of Simulation Objects Executing X Events" shows the number of
  simulation objects that process that total number (the x-axis index) of events.

* Computed as: for each X, show the number of simulation objects that execute X total
  events.

## Available Parallelism

### Total Events Available for Execution at Each Event Scheduling Cycle

Assuming a unit time execution time for all events and that all available events are
executed at once, this plot should show the number of scheduling cycles with X events
available for execution.  

* x-axis: labeled "Scheduling Cycle Number".  Enumerating the schedling cycles 1:N.

* y-axis, labeled "Number of Events Available for Execution".  Contains the range of
  events available.  The range of the x-axis is N:M, where N is the minimum number of
  events found and M is the maximum number of events found.

* Computed as: 
  
```AsciiDoc
define a vector for each simulation as a vector ordered by receive_time, call this simulation_object[i].event_vector
events_available = 0;
forall i events_available[i] = 0;
while (at least one simulation_objects_has_more_events) {
  schedule_cycle = minimum_receive_time for the head event in all simulation_objects;
  foreach i such that (simulation_object[i].event_vector.receive_time >= schedule_cycle and
                       simulation_object[i].event_vector.receive_time < schedule_cycle) {
    events_availble[schedule_cycle]++;
    advance simulation_object[i] event_vector;
  }
}
for i in range (1:schedule_cycle) {
  plot 1,events_available[i];
}
```

### Number of Event Cycles with X Events available for Execution.

Assuming a unit time execution time for all events and that all available events are
executed at once, this plot should show the number of scheduling cycles with X events
available for execution.  

* x-axis, labeled "Number of Events Available for Execution".  Contains the range of
  events available.  The range of the x-axis is N:M, where N is the minimum number of
  events found and M is the maximum number of events found.

* y-axis: labeled "Number of Scheduling Cycles"  Shows the number of scheduling cycles
  that number of events was available for execution.

* Computed as: summarize results events_available from graph data showing "Events
  Available for Execution by Scheduling Cycle".

## Lookahead

Must lookup the formal definition of this.

* x-axis: labeled "Simulation Objects", enumerates the names of the simulation objects
  in the model.  

* y-axis: labeled "Lookahead", showing (for each simulation object), the minimum, average,
  and maximum lookahead for that simulation object.

* Computed as:
