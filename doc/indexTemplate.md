  this next paragraph assumes that the tools generate a file "model_summary.html" that
  contains information on the tool, simulation model, command line arguments, and
  configuration information.  in each section below, the image name in the markdown link

This page summarizes results from analyzing the characteristics of the event profile of a
discrete event simulation model.  The the model name, the tool its profile characteristics
were generated from, the date of the capture, and the relevant command line arguments and
configuration parameters are available [here](./graphs/model_summary.html).

The following analysis activities are parallel simulation centric.  Thus, we assume, for
example, that the discrete event simulation is composed of events processed by LPs.

## Event Execution Summaries

### Total Number of Events Executed by the LPs

This is an x-y chart that summarizes the total events processed in the simulation.

* x-axis: labeled "LPs", enumerates the names of the LPs in the model.

* y-axis: labeled "Total Number of Events", show the total number of events that are to be
  executed by the corresponding LP.

* Computed as: for each LP, simply sum the number of events that are with a
  "destination_LP" field corresponding to that LP.

![total_executed_events_by_lp](./graphs/total_executed_events_by_lp.pdf)

### Number of LPs Executing X Events

This an x-y chart that shows the number of LPs that process X events.  

* x-axis: labeled "Number of Events Executed" contains the integer range of events (from
  minimum to maximum) executed by any LP in the model.  For example, assume that N is the
  minimum number of events executed by a LP and M is the maximum number of events excuted
  by a LP, then the x-axis will be the range N:M.

* y-axis: labeled "Number of LPs Executing X Events" shows the number of LPs that process
  that total number (the x-axis index) of events.

* Computed as: for each X, show the number of LPs that execute X total events.

## Available Parallelism

### Total Events Available for Execution at Each Event Scheduling Cycle

Assuming a unit time execution time for all events and that all available events are
executed at once, this plot should show the number of scheduling cycles with X events
available for execution.

* x-axis: labeled "Scheduling Cycle Number".  Enumerating the schedling cycles 1:N.

* y-axis, labeled "Number of Events Available for Execution".  Contains the range of
  events available.  The range of the x-axis is N:M, where N is the minimum number of
  events found and M is the maximum number of events found.

* Computed as: 
  
```AsciiDoc
define a vector for each simulation as a vector ordered by receive_time, call this lp[i].event_vector
total_schedule_cycles = 0;
forall i events_available[i] = 0;
while (at least one lps_has_more_events) {
  schedule_time = minimum_receive_time for the head event in all lps;
  foreach i such that (lp[i].event_vector.receive_time >= schedule_time and
                       lp[i].event_vector.send_time < schedule_time) {
    events_availble[schedule_time]++;
    advance lp[i] event_vector;
  }
  total_schedule_cycles++;
}
for i in range (1:schedule_time) {
  plot 1,events_available[i];
}
```

We need to preserve/report the total_schedule_cycles from the above algorithm.  It tells
us the number of unit execution cycles through the critical path.  For now I suppose it
could be displayed in the graph (if that is convenient).  Perhaps it will come up again in
another graphic (I'm assuming so, but have to think on what other graphs we may want to
generate).

### Number of Event Cycles with X Events available for Execution.

Assuming a unit time execution time for all events and that all available events are
executed at once, this plot should show the number of scheduling cycles with X events
available for execution.

* x-axis, labeled "Number of Events Available for Execution".  Contains the range of
  events available.  The range of the x-axis is N:M, where N is the minimum number of
  events found and M is the maximum number of events found.

* y-axis: labeled "Number of Scheduling Cycles" Shows the number of scheduling cycles that
  number of events was available for execution.

* Computed as: summarize results events_available from graph data showing "Events
  Available for Execution by Scheduling Cycle".

## Lookahead

Must lookup the formal definition of this.

* x-axis: labeled "LPs", enumerates the names of the LPs in the model.

* y-axis: labeled "Lookahead", showing (for each LP), the minimum, average, and maximum
  lookahead for that LP.

* Computed as: to be determined.
