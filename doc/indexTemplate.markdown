<!-- 
  this next paragraph assumes that the tools generate a file "model_summary.html" that
  contains information on the tool, simulation model, command line arguments, and
  configuration information.  in each section below, the image name in the markdown link
  should be the name of the file generated by the analysis tool corresponding to the
  description in that section.

This page summarizes results from analyzing the characteristics of the event profile of a
discrete event simulation model.  The the model name, the tool its profile characteristics
were generated from, the date of the capture, and the relevant command line arguments and
configuration parameters are available [here](./graphs/model_summary.html).

The following analysis activities are parallel simulation centric.  Thus, we assume, for
example, that the discrete event simulation is composed of events processed by simulation
objects. 

## Event Execution Summaries

### Total Number of Events Executed by the Simulation Objects

This is an x-y chart that summarizes the total events processed in the simulation.
The x-axis containing the simulation objects and y-axis containing the total number of 
events that simulation object executes.

### Number of Simulation Objects Executing X Events

This an x-y chart that shows the number of simulation objects that process X events.  The
x-axis contains the range of events (from minimum to maximum) executed by any simulation
object in the model.  The y-axis shows the number of simulation objects that process that
number (the x-axis index) of events.
