While\r\nthe initial goals are to learn more about the structure and nature of the simulation\r\nmodels and their suitability for parallelism.  Opportunities for learning about the\r\nsimulation models in order to draw any meaningful conclusions about them will also be\r\nincorporated.  For example, anything we can learn about relationships between simulation\r\nobjects that could be used to derive strategies for static analysis and model\r\ntransformation/optimization by mechanized tools would also be a highly desirable\r\nobjective.  Ideally the approach will capture the profile data in a generic intermediate\r\nrepresentation so that the captured data can analyzed from a large number of DES\r\nsimulation tools.  While initially we will develop tools and methods to study individual\r\nsimulation models, the ultimate goal will be to figure out how to bring information\r\ntogether from multiple simulation models to draw conclusions on the common characteristics\r\nof, in particular large, simulation models.  Initially we will focus on the capture and\r\nanalysis of event data.\r\n\r\nThis project is developed from a PDES centric view.  In particular, we use term\r\n\"simulation object\" throughout which is not necessarily a strict construct within a\r\nsequential simulator.  However, we will stick with this it will help us to effectively\r\norganize and structure our profile data and analysis activities in ways that will be most\r\nuseful for us and our parallel simulation work.\r\n\r\n## Strategy\r\n\r\nThe general strategy will be to instrument existing simulators to capture event data for\r\noffline analysis.  Ideally we will use a wide array of different discrete event simulators\r\ncontaining simulation models written by others (and ideally, domain experts from across\r\nmultiple disciplines).  This will require that we have source code to the simulator or\r\nprogramming cooperation from the community of the target simulation engine.\r\n\r\nThe second (larger) part of this project is the data analysis activity.  The objective of\r\nthis is to discover meaningful understandings of the characteristics of the simulation\r\nmodels.  While there are specific analysis results that we expect to see in this phase, as\r\nwe advance our studies in this space, we are likely to expand the types of analyses that\r\nperformed.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
