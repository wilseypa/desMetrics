# Graphics for the DESMetrics project

There are currently three files, the original `desGraphics.py`, the newer `visualizations.py` which was used for the DSRT publication, and an even newer `graphics.py` which will be the combination of the two, and used for further publications and Sean Kane's M.S. Thesis.
