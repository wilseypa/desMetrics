desMetrics
==========

Profiling discrete-event simulation models.  This project: (i) instruments a discrete-event simulator to capture event generation
and execution data over time to a file; (ii) analyzes the event data and extracts various properties of the relation of events (LP
communities, average time delta between when an event is generated and when executed, the number of events generated for local or
remote LPs, and so on); and (iii) generates graphs/plots of the analysis results.

This project is currently inactive.
